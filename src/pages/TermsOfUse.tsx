    html: '<p> Bancor provides an execution-only service and does not advise on the merits of any particular conversion of Tokens or its tax or legal consequences. As a general matter, Users should be aware of the following prior to utilizing our Content. </p> <p> a. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems and Currencies. By using the Content and the Bancor Network in any way, you acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and ecosystems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like BNT, ETH, EOS, smart contract based tokens (for example, such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard) and blockchain-based software systems. You understand that blockchain technologies (such as Ethereum and EOS) and associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies (where applicable) is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the relevant blockchain (such as Ethereum). You acknowledge these risks and represent that Bancor cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the process of converting BNT or ETH and that Bancor does not offer any such service. Bancor cannot be held liable for any losses or damages of BNT, ETH or other cryptocurrencies resulting from the use of services of any third-party provider. </p> <p> b. Assumption of Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions. The Content as well as the Bancor Network and relevant blockchain (such as Ethereum or EOS) could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of Bancor to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Content, the Bancor Network or the applicable blockchain. Bancor endeavours to comply with all applicable laws, i.e. all legal requests for information, and reserve the right to provide information, including Project Information, to law enforcement personnel and other third parties to answer inquiries, to respond to legal process, to respond to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court’s authority and to protect Bancor Network and its Users. </p> <p> c. Understanding Tokens requires advanced technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on the Site does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. In using the Content, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks relating to and concerning the Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any conversion or any underlying Token. </p> <p> d. You accept the risk of converting Tokens. You understand the conversion of Tokens may use untested code and protocols. You accept the risk of conversion failure or fault. You agree not to hold Bancor accountable for any related losses. Neither you nor we, can reverse, change or cancel a conversion of Tokens transaction marked as complete or pending. Conversion of Tokens using the Content is managed and confirmed via the relevant blockchain. You understand that your relevant blockchain (Ethereum, EOS or other) public address will be made publicly visible whenever you use the Content. </p> <p> e. You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that Bancor is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your conversions, including with respect to tax or money transferring regulations. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Content. </p> <p> f. You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Site and the Content may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties, which may hinder the use of the Content or affect or even cause faults or failures in the conversion of Tokens. You agree not to hold Bancor accountable for any related losses. </p> <p> g. Bancor does not advise on converting risk. If at any point Bancor or its representatives do provide converting recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of truth or due diligence on behalf of Bancor or its representatives. </p> <p> h. Operation of Token Protocol. We do not own or control the underlying software protocols, which govern the operation of the Tokens (other than the BNT) supported on our platform. You acknowledge and agree (i) that the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (‘forks’), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and even the name of the Tokens you store.
